# Semantic Versioning Specification

"Semantic Versioning" or "SemVer" contain a set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented. You can find full document in [semver.md](./semver.md) or visit our official website [semver.org](https://semver.org) to find previous versions and localized specifications.

## Save

The "Save" feature allows you to save the current state of your project, including all dependencies and configurations, to a file. This can be useful for creating backups or sharing your project with others.

### Example

To use the "Save" feature, run the following command:

```sh
npm run save
```

This will create a file named `project-save.json` in the root directory of your project, containing all the necessary information to restore the project to its current state.
