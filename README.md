# Semantic Versioning Specification

"Semantic Versioning" or "SemVer" contain a set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented. You can find full document in [semver.md](./semver.md) or visit our official website [semver.org](https://semver.org) to find previous versions and localized specifications.

Changes to the document are published to the website by a [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/semver/semver.org/blob/gh-pages/.github/workflows/sync.yml) which runs once each day.
